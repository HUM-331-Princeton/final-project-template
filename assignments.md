## Digital Tools Assignment #3: XML and TEI

In this assignment, you'll select a text from your research or from a historical source that interests you and encode it with XML using categories in-keeping with the Text Encoding Initiative standards. You'll imagine what a future reader might want to discover from your chosen text and develop a tagging schema to render it into useable data.

## Digital Tools Assignment #4: Cytoscape

In this assignment, you will create a dataset of at least 100 nodes which you will input into Cytoscape for network visualization and analysis. Your dataset may be one we discuss in class, or it may be one that pertains to your final project's primary source.

## Final Project Website

You and a partner will work together to research and craft a narrative argument about a source in Princeton University Special Collections. Using a template you'll copy in our course GitHub repository, you'll then build and customize a website that presents this source to an educated general reader, thinking through the possibilities of digital storytelling beyond the static page.
